# 2 HTML-CSS file generator

----------------------------

Idea for that project is not clear. I have challnged myself to learn/give a try to Ruby since programming is like hammering nails and it should not be big difference only hammers will have various feature. On the begging idea was just to generate one file but now I'm thinking to make it in Ruby on Rails as an app generates files for user on website by pushing a one button
